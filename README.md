Detailed Inferences/Conclusion

> Risk for Small Caps is higher than Large Caps for all 4 time periods.
> Risk for Value Stocks ( Low P/B ratio) is higher than the Growth Stocks for all 4 time periods.
> Our results are consistent with Size and Value Effect. 
> Return for Small Cap is higher only for 1 year period. For other time periods its less than Large caps stocks.
> Returns for Value Stocks is less than Growth Stocks except for 1 year for which we could not say that there is significant diff.
> For Returns, the 1-year results are consistent with the size effect.
> For other 3 time intervals, the Size Effect and Value Effect could not be seen.

So In India,
> Its better to go for Large Cap Stocks as risk is less and returns are higher though in short term (1 year period), small cap stocks can give higher returns but the risk will be on the higher side.
> Its better to go for the Growth Stocks i.e. stock with high P/B ratio as returns are higher and risk is less.
